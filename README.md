# OnChainBunnies
OnChainBunnies is a collection created to test on-chain optimization for a thesis of a master student at KULeuven.

# Thesis
The thesis examines two paths to optimize on-chain deployment cost. 
In a first path NFT collections without traits are examined.
In a second path NFT collection with traits, where OnChainBunnies is the main example used, are examined.

# Whitepaper
The whitepaper contains all best optimizations found in the thesis for NFT collection with traits and presents the OnChainBunnies collection in more detail. Furthermore, an algorithm to exclude insider trading during reveal is proposed.

# Code
Code can be found as part of the ERC721F, under examples (OnChainOptimized.sol).
